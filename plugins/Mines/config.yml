Tasks:
    Queues:
        Timer: 0 # Seconds (POSSIBLE PERFORMANCE BOOST)
        # Mines resetting causing lag? Enable this! (Suggested to try 3 at 1st, increase if needed)
        #
        # Queues allow you to add delays inbetween each mine resetting.
        # Changing this will require a server reboot to work.
    Percentage:
        Timer: 1 # Seconds (POSSIBLE PERFORMANCE BOOST) - (POSSIBLE ACCURACY BOOST)
        # Are you using Timed Resets or just not using percentages to reset? Disable this! (Set it to 0)
        #
        # Changing this affects how many seconds all the mines are checked for their percentages left.
        #
        # 50-100 mines: Suggested to set this number to 3-6.
        # If you have 100+ mines, I'd highly suggest raising this number to 7-10.
        #
        # Note: Upping this number will affect "Percentage Mined/Left" & "Percentage to reset" accuracy.
    Holograms:
        Timer: 3 # Seconds (POSSIBLE PERFORMANCE BOOST)
        # Not using Mines built in hologram system? (You... you should be.) Disable this! (Set it to 0)
        #
        # Changing this affects how often all the Mines holograms are updated.
    Signs:
        Timer: 1 # Seconds (POSSIBLE PERFORMANCE BOOST)
        # Not using Mine Signs? Disable this!
        #
        # This timer affects when Mine Signs are updated.
        Enable-Reset-Signs-Cooldown: true # Not using any Mine reset signs? Disable this! (POSSIBLE PERFORMANCE BOOST)

Performance-Focused: false # (POSSIBLE PERFORMANCE BOOST)
# Enabling this makes Mines reset asynchronously. (More efficient)
#
# Enabling this will cause Mines to completely ignore both the 'MinePreResetEvent' & 'MinePostResetEvent'
#
# If you don't even know what these two events are or what they're used for, it's highly suggested to enable this option.
# Changing this requires your server to be restarted.

Settings:
    Check-For-Updates: true # (POSSIBLE ACCURACY BOOST)
    Mine-Fly-Height: 3
    # The amount of blocks above a mine that mine fly will cut off at.
    Mine-Effects-Height: 3
    # The amount of blocks above a mine that the mines effects will work within'.
    Broadcast-Mines-Resetting: false
    # true = All mines will broadcast that they reset & alert players that are teleported out of them.
    # false = No broadcasts & no player teleport message alerts.
    Allow-Block-Breaking-While-Mines-Reset: true # (POSSIBLE ACCURACY BOOST)
    # true = Percentage data for Mines WILL NOT BE accurate if blocks are broken prior to the Mine completely resetting.
    # false = Recommended for "Percentage to Reset" usage.
